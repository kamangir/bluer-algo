  \ with the molecules and small particles in the air. This interaction is known as\
  \ Rayleigh scattering. The shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet,\
  \ are scattered more efficiently by the atmosphere than the longer wavelengths,\
  \ like red and orange. As a result, the scattered blue light is distributed throughout\
  \ the sky, making it appear blue to our eyes during the day."
